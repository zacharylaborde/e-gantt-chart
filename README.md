# [E-Gantt-Chart](https://website-name.com)
The E-Gantt-Chart aims to be a versatile and highly customizable 
open-source tool for developers, designed to simplify the creation 
of scheduling and project management applications without us devs 
needing to pay thousands of dollars or re-invent the wheel. The
e-gantt-chart is a [Web Component](https://https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
which means it can be used in any Browser or Chromium-based application
(such as [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)) and it can easily 
integrate with any framework (including [React](https://react.dev/), 
[Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)).

### Key Features
* **Easy Integration**: Quickly add a Gantt chart to your project.
* **Customizable**: Tailor it to match your application's style with css.
* **Command-based Architecture**: Insert callbacks to complete before or 
after an interaction for maximum flexibility.
* **Interactivity**: Easily manage tasks with drag-and-drop + resizing.
* **Open Source**: Use it for free, suggest changes, or 
[contribute](#contribute) if you wish.

## Usage
### Quick Start Instructions
To get started, I would recommend testing it out in a playground 
environment first before implementing it in your own project. To 
start using the component, simply drag the 'eganttchart' folder 
into your directory, and you can see examples of its usage in the 
example.js files. By default, the index.html file uses the index.js 
file. For styling, you can look into egc_dark_theme.css to see 
examples on how to customize your gantt chart. 


## Contribute
Currently, the best way to contribute will be to submit issues to
the repository and I will get to work on them. In the future I will
allow people to create pull requests and submit improvements for my
review.
